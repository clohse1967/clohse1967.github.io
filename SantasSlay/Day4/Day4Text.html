<h4>Then they asked Jackson's <a href="Day4/AdamCooperInterview2.pdf" target="_blank" Title="Adam Cooper's Second Interview" >co-worker Adam</a> and his <a href="Day4/SylviaMasonInterview2.pdf" target="_blank" Title="Sylvia Mason's Second Interview" >friend Sylvia</a> to come in again to answer some open questions.</h4>

<h4>That afternoon, the detectives got a <a href="Day4/MasonSearchWarrant.pdf" target="_blank" Title="Mason - Search Warrant" >warrant to search</a> one of their suspect's residences. Some evidence discovered there led them to get <a href="Day4/WalkerSearchWarrant.pdf" target="_blank" Title="Walker - Search Warrant" >another warrant</a> to search an additional suspect's residence.</h4>
