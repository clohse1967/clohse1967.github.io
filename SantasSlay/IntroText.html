	<h2><p>What Happened to Jackson Walker?</p></h2>
	<h4>Jackson Walker attended his department's holiday party and Secret Santa gift exchange on Thursday, and then he called in sick on Friday.</h4>
	<h4>When he didn't show up or call on Monday, a co-worker went to check on him and found him dead.</h4>
	<h4>Was this 29-year-old, generally healthy man sicker than anyone realized, or did someone make sure he didn't live to see Christmas?</h4>
